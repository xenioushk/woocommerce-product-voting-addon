## WooCommerce Product Voting Addon

This addon allows you to automatically display a custom **voting interface** with every product in your WooCommerce-powered site. Your user can easily sort products based on the most `liked/disliked` votes. That will give your user a quick and smart overview of products. The user will be able to submit their feedback for a `negative/down` vote. This will give you a chance to improve your products.

The addon comes with a custom widget box feature. So, you can display custom WooCommerce widgets on the site's side bars. The widget also provides the date range **(1 day/1 week/1 month/6 month)** filtering options.
